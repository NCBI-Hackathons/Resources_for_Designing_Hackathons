                    <h2>Team Leader Information</h2>
                    <p>A team leader is responsible for proposing a project for the event and having a clear vision for
                        developing a solution. To accomplish their goal team leader is responsible for leading their
                        team of 5-6 individuals at the event - this means clearly defining and delegating tasks,
                        incorporating team membersâ€™ ideas to accomplish the goal at stake, and ensuring success of the
                        team. Great team leaders will understand the science involved in their project and, if a software
                        prototype is involved, will manage its development. Not all projects have to be software oriented
                        - anything that might benefit from the efforts of a group of talented people collaborating is welcome.
                    </p>
