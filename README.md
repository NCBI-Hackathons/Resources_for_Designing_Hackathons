# Resources_for_Designing_Hackathons

This repo will initially contain two files. 

The first is a proposed daily schedule, intended to be a rough outline of the daily workflow for an "anabolic" hackathon.
The second is a scientific outline, from the August 2015 NCBI hackathon, roughly showing the depth at which projects were planned for that event.
